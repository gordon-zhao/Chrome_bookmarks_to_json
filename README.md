# Chrome bookmarks to json
Convert exported chrome bookmarks to JSON

## Usage
  * python html2json.py path_to_bookmark.html path_to_save_json.json
  * (Add sudo if writting to a path that needs root permissions)
  * Or python html2json.py, enter the path to exported bookmark, then enter the path for saving the json file
  
## Known Issue
  Because Chrome does not count "Other bookmarks" as a bookmark folder in the exported html file, the folders under "Other bookmarks" will be under "Bookmarks" folder
  
## Json Structure:

```
  "Bookmarks":
       {
          "Folder A": {
              "Folder A_A":{}, 
              "link":'[[bookmark_name, bookmark_link]]'
          }
          "Folder B": {
              "Folder B_A":{}, 
              "link":'[[bookmark_name, bookmark_link]]'
          }
          "link":[
              [bookmark_name, bookmark_link]
          ]
      }
```
